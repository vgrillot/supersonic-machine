The manual says that completing upper lanes (1 - 5) scores 25,000 points at any time. But with the available rules cards there is no rule where this is marked (see below). Also the recommended score for to get a replay is with 120,000 / 260,000 (for 3-ball) and 220,000 / 480,000 (for 5-ball) a little low when scoring 25,000 points with each completion. Is anybody outside there who played this machine in real life or is even an owner of this pinball who can tell me, how it is used? Thanks for help ...
